To summarize, this problem is a variation of the minimum spanning tree problem, with 3d points. Part 1 of the problem asks us to connect the 1000 closest set of points together, and return the product of the sizes of the three largest interconnected sets of points. Part 2 asks for the product of the x components of the final 2 points to be connected to ensure that all of the points are connected. The series of questions suggests implementing Kruskal's algorithm, which was implemented.
